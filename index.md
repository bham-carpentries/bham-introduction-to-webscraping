# Introduction
Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites. Some data that is available on the web is presented in a format that makes it easier to collect and use it, for example in the form of downloadable comma-separated values (CSV) datasets that can then be imported in a spreadsheet or loaded into a data analysis script. Often however, even though it is publicly available, data is not readily available for reuse. For example it can be contained in a PDF, or a table on a website, or spread across multiple web pages.

There are a variety of ways to scrape a website to extract information for reuse. In its simplest form, this can be achieved by copying and pasting snippets from a web page, but this can be unpractical if there is a large amount of data to be extracted, or if it is spread over a large number of pages. Instead, specialized tools and techniques can be used to automate this process, by defining what sites to visit, what information to look for, and whether data extraction should stop once the end of a page has been reached, or whether to follow hyperlinks and repeat the process recursively. Automating web scraping also allows to define whether the process should be run at regular intervals and capture changes in the data.

This lesson gives an introduction to the structure of websites, introduces some tools to extract data from well-structured websites and discusses the legal and ethical implications of extracting and using that data.

## Learning Objectives
After attending this training, participants will be able to:
* Understand the structure of a webpage and its underlying source code
* Identify different methods of gathering data from a webpage
* Use the WebScraper browser extension to extract data from webpages
* Assess the legal and ethical implications of using data gathered from a webpage

::: prereq
- This lesson does not assume any previous knowledge about web scraping 
- Participants should be able to use a web browser
